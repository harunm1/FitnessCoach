# AI session log

Required by the ECE1724 project handout: representative AI interactions, what was asked, what came back, and what the team did with it. Each of us appends our own entries.

### 23 October 2026, tooling on the skeleton (issue #1)

**Asked:** how to add Prettier to the Next.js ESLint flat config without the two fighting over formatting, and what a minimal GitHub Actions workflow for a Next.js app looks like.

**Got:** the Next.js ESLint docs recommend `eslint-config-prettier` added last in `extends`; `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` needs `tailwindStylesheet` pointed at the CSS entry point under Tailwind v4 because there is no `tailwind.config.js`; a workflow with `npm ci` then format check, lint, typecheck and build.

**Did with it:** wrote `prettier.config.mjs`, `.prettierignore`, the `extends` change and the npm scripts myself; ran all four checks locally before committing; verified the `extends` order against the Next.js docs page rather than taking it on trust. The lint run is slow on my machine (WSL on a Windows mount), so CI is the gate.

### 23 October 2026, first Prisma schema and seed (issue #2)

**Before asking:** I sketched the tables from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: profile and quiz answers, an exercise library the coach picks from by id, plan to plan day to exercise slot, workouts and logged sets, coach conversations scoped to the user, progress photos stored as a bucket key only, and the four access tiers as an enum. Open questions I had: whether to use string ids so Better Auth's adapter fits later, and where Prisma 7 expects the seed command.

**Asked:** whether the lecture's Prisma 7 setup (`prisma7.config.ts`, `prisma-client` generator, `@prisma/adapter-pg`) carries over to Next.js unchanged, how to keep one client across hot reloads, and whether a `postinstall` is the usual way to regenerate the client in CI.

**Got:** the setup carries over; `prisma init` produces the same files as Lecture 3 p53 to p56; in Prisma 7 the seed command lives under `migrations.seed` in the config file, not `package.json` (the CLI said so when I ran `prisma db seed`); a `globalThis` guard for the client in development; `postinstall: prisma generate` so a clean `npm ci` has the client before typecheck.

**Did with it:** wrote the schema and seed myself, ran the init migration against a local PostgreSQL, seeded 876 exercises from free-exercise-db plus a demo user, ran the seed twice to confirm upserts make it idempotent, then deleted the generated client and ran a clean install to confirm typecheck still passes.
